 i'm john doe tag, not question
 None, not question
 problem might be, not question
 objective function, not question
 and finally its the old joke, not question
 for fifteen dollars it won't get me there before five, not question
 what is the model to me i think of it is an experimental device,question
 be so by, not question
 and which to leave behind, not question
 so the objective function something you either minimizing or maximizing, not question
 let's say that i'm allowed fifteen hundred calories of food, not question
 call the knapsack problem, not question
 alright pretty abstract let's talk about the specific optimization problem, not question
 we'll talk about three kinds of models optimization models, not question
 but also there's a lot more i would say, not question
 familiarity with some simple algorithms, not question
 i'll be a final exam based upon all of the above, not question
 and so the burglar has to solve the optimization problem, not question
 representing the set of available items, not question
 the item is represented by a pair, not question
 continue s are so called fractional knapsack problem says i can take pieces of it, not question
 but has a knapsack that will only hold a fine art amount of stuff that he or she wishes to steal, not question
 finance, not question
 or am i only allows predict the future something that hasn't happened, not question
 so essentially i'm gonna use a binary number to represent the set of items i choose to take, not question
 involves, not question
 None, not question
 item three say it beeps three is zero, not question
 None, not question
 i'm at wanna find a root by car or plane or train, not question
 of length and, not question
 how do we use computation to understand the world in which we live, question
 okay so i kind of use mathematics to describe the backpack problem, not question
 really to fall the six from zero one problem sex, not question
 and the weight of the item, not question
 it's what we old people used to call a backpack, not question
 and it was i was ten minutes into it for real life most of the class had no idea what a knapsack was, not question
 let's look at an example, not question
 i am trying to take, not question
 as will see if, not question
 more emphasis in using packages, not question
 what i only have a hundred dollars to spend so that option is off the table, question
 but it all has to fit in the knapsack, not question
 fastest way to get from new york to boston is to take a plane, not question
 usually it's call, not question
 anyway, not question
 let's assume the knapsack can accommodate items for the total weight, not question
 None, not question
 fraction of this food, not question
 there's more stuff than you can carry and you have to choose which stuff to take, not question
 odds are you'll be fine a way but that's the safest way to do it so, not question
 None, not question
 i'm not taking the item, not question
 conceptual algorithmic material in six tripple zero two, not question
 and you can, not question
 once i take something that's fourteen hundred, not question
 you want to maximize your value, not question
 extra point zero one, not question
 so essentially what's happening, not question
 and then you move on to the next thing, not question
 somebody walks up to a taxi driver in new york city, not question
 the main topic of of course is what i think of its computational models, not question
 alright welcome to six tripple zero two or if you and six hundred in the second half of six hundred, not question
 in the future, not question
 who breaks into a house and want to steal a bunch of stuff, not question
 is it mi to open course ware at os ew dot am it dot edu, not question
 and they used to look more like that than they look today, not question
 and i can't add up to more than fifteen hundred calories, not question
 and that's really the only way to learn to program is practice practice practice, not question
 so the knapsack problem, not question
 looking at his food, not question
 and says i'm lost how do i get to carnegie hall the taxi driver turns to the person says practice practice practice, not question
 but you can solve it with what's called a greedy algorithm will talk much more about this is we go forward, not question
 yes which of these might be the most valuable items here, not question
 can't avoid using optimization algorithm as you as you get through life, not question
 where you take the best thing first as long as you can, not question
 reading assignments in the textbooks, not question
 i'll be a few additional bits of iphone today for example will talk about lambda abstractions, not question
 so let's talk first about optimization models, not question
 is moving out of the wet lab, not question
 in words written words what i just said or like, not question
 if three is one, not question
 some, not question
 i commute to work using ways which essentially is solving not very well i believe in optimization problem to minimize my time from home to here, not question
 so once i take one thing at constrains possible solutions, not question
 it minimizes the total travel time, not question
 and essentially, not question
 and as well see there's an asymmetry here, not question
 and the continuous the zero one, not question
 if you talk six triple zero one or you took the six tripple zero one advanced standing exam, not question
 something like that, not question
 it would be illustrated by something like this, not question
 because i'll be more focus on the problem to be solved and on the actual programming the lecture content more abstract, not question
 so we have, not question
 to each element of the vector represents an item, not question
 i should point out that there are two variants of it there's the zero one knapsack problem, not question
 so maybe, not question
 preferably python three point five, not question
 is four to build the model that explains phenomena we see every day, not question
 what's the work load their problem sex do all the programming problems much in the style of six tripple zero one, question
 you'll be fine, not question
 hopefully it will go a little bit smoother than in the last problem set in, not question
 None, not question
 we use these things all the time, not question
 we've tried to choose different examples for lectures and from the textbooks for the most part, not question
 about programming but, not question
 point is technically knapsack problems are not physical knapsack split some conceptual idea, not question
 or so for example from going from new york to boston, not question
 or maybe i have to be in boston before five pm and while the bus would get me there before, not question
 when you travel maybe you log into to various advisory programs that that that trying optimize things for you, not question
 i knew pause for a second, not question
 is, not question
 and the gold, not question
 the first time i talked about the knapsack problem i neglected to show a picture of an app sac, not question
 i do want you to hold your programming skills, not question
 None, not question
 value of the item, not question
 well you fill up your knapsack with gold, not question
 i apologize for the short variable names but they are easy to fit on a slide finally will have a vector l, not question
 so my check to function would be the number of minutes spent in transit getting from a to b, not question
 it's interesting again there thing showing up on your screen not showing up on my screen, not question
 my least favorite cuz i always wanna eat more than i'm supposed to be, not question
 maybe twelve hundred calories and everything else is more than three hundred, not question
 if you still in last place when you take as many reasons that you can fit in, not question
 you haven't run out of space your mouth puts over until you run out of space, not question
 i'll get the most for this when i fence it, not question
 i take that whole bar or i take none of it, not question
 and then we can build probably a slightly different model that might predict what will be like, not question
 None, not question
 they're all over the place today you really, not question
 we can build models that sort of explain how the climate changed over the millennia, not question
 anything to install the continuous problem, not question
 None, not question
 it's in the ready maximize to minimize, not question
 and constraint it has to fit in my backpack, not question
 lectures will be an ad in speaking you from mr clean a bit faster paced, not question
 is this something we had an items to choose from, not question
 as we'll talk about it traditional experimentation will is and will remain important, not question
 that eliminates some solutions, not question
 None, not question
 and into the computer, not question
 because once you make a decision it will affect the future decisions, not question
 it will help mi to open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 so here it is, not question
 we then off and have to wear on top of that objective function, not question
 so you can think of for example climate change model, not question
 it maximizes the some, not question
 and a set of constraints, not question
 and the course is really less about programming and more about dipping your toe into the exotic world data science, not question
 the sex with students reported in the path, not question
 and these are my options, not question
 i've already posted the first reading assignment, not question
 while baking a constraint, not question
 now it has to really be supplemented by computation, not question
 we have to obey, not question
 what setting in your head, question
 tv the ran out of gold ran out of space, not question
 gonna try and find a vector of the, not question
 the typical models and simulation models, not question
 by the constraints there on the amount of money i can spend, not question
 familiarity with concepts of computational complexity you'll see even in today's lecture will be assuming that, not question
 inevitably some comments about software engineering had a structure code, not question
 and so maybe what i'm left with is, not question
 recitation says, not question
 so lot of, not question
 a greedy algorithm as we'll see if not guarantee to give me the best answer alright let's look at a formal was asian of it, not question
 i'm, not question
 it's easy to self, not question
 is gonna indicate whether or not an item was taken, not question
 sometimes not, not question
 they should provide you a very different take on the same material covering and lectures, not question
 the programming assignments are going to be a bit easier, not question
 maybe if i take my gold bar and she didn't gold dust, not question
 i'm, not question
 okay so those are the items we have and then another vector v, not question
 continuous knapsack problem is really boring, not question
 None, not question
 so the zero one knapsack problem mean she will you take the object are you don't, not question
 set of constraints, not question
 they're harmless things like how my mouse works, not question
 driving, not question
 let me start with a few administrative things, not question
 are mostly about you learning to be a programmer, not question
 finger exercises small things if they're taking you more than fifteen minutes, not question
 so just shows i can now very nicely represent what i've done by single vector, not question
 increasingly i'm sure you all see that you were science majors and increasing reliance on computation, not question
 a lot of that carries over no woman has to be a programmer in half a semester, not question
 of no more than we, not question
 so it, not question
 and i should probably warn you if your hungry this is not gonna be a fun lecture so here's, not question
 stealing the stuff with the most value, not question
 let us know they really shouldn't, not question
 and that's typically the way we deal with these optimization problems we start with some informal description and then we translate them into mathematical representation, not question
 None, not question
 it can help us to either understand something that has happened, not question
 suppose you had over here a pile of gold and a pile of silver and a pile raisins, not question
 i have to go about deciding, not question
 so you get to see things in two thousand different ways, not question
 oh hang on to your seats, not question
 here is, not question
 then can say well the whole thing won't fit in but i can fit in a pass part of it, not question
 i can't handle these two things differently, not question
 to make a donation or to view additional materials from hundreds of them it courses, not question
 of zeros and ones, not question
 zero one knapsack problem as much more complicated, not question
 and the problem sets are designed to help cement back as well just give you programming experience, not question
 in there generally designed to help you learn a single concept usually programming concept, not question
 important to get this set up because we're gonna see now depends upon, not question
 alright prerequisites experience writing object oriented programs in python on, not question
 times by supply, not question
 we have lots of jessie's of both and genders, not question
 we're never gonna make that mistake again, not question
 None, not question
 it's a very powerful feeling that month contract contract but not the demonstration i want dora anybody thinking i'm cheating so that's just, not question
 situations in which somebody doesn't, not question
 what a little bit more confrontational but when it which was very familiar to but i want to first grade most cases it's the problem of the farmer the fox news in the rain, not question
 approach to a problem, not question
 None, not question
 oh my mac and explain the best by filling up with example, not question
 so here's how it works, not question
 None, not question
 and then i'll give me a little bit of the history of artificial intelligence and conclude with some of the covenants by which we run the course one of which is no laptops please, not question
 so i can use to, not question
 he ran into someone at a bar or rolls and ask you what you doing my t, not question
 None, not question
 how's the first of our powerful ideas for today, question
 the sycamore something, not question
 the rain, not question
 and maybe a picture of a farmer, not question
 that's pretty simple as turning pages when the time, not question
 are done can you change your hairstyle want do sure you thane of car doors not taking the course this semester, not question
 how many such situations are there, question
 individuals can be on one side or the other, not question
 but i wanna give you a second example, not question
 next twenty four hours to, not question
 what is it a country, question
 i know where to class i hope it's not the last of the species, not question
 is the wheel comes flying over the top my blunt like what's gonna happen one piece, question
 why are there not sixteen, question
 None, not question
 and the allowed connections between them, not question
 until i find something looks like the sleeve, not question
 it's such a simple idea owner here to get in the subject but it need to adhere repertoire of problem solving methods techniques and ten procedures algorithms, not question
 tune in for something a power over you start to talk about so i can save you doing in generate and test, not question
 None, not question
 making a model of the facilitate an understanding, not question
 explain why we have these covenants at the end, not question
 some possible solutions, not question
 so we talking about this frequently from now on the rest this master the power of being able to name things, not question
 why do some brown sugar just to be sure, not question
 and here's the farmer, not question
 that's the one where the other, not question
 so much about you're going to accumulate in the subject is a sweet of representations that will help you to build programs are intelligent, not question
 all for the suitable song at some point, not question
 there's a scenario and here and glorious green representing our elves i infested reverses the river, not question
 nice cover, not question
 you're a bunch of interesting people it's always interesting to see what people named their children two decades ago and i finally were overwhelmed with families and their not too many peters pauls and mary's but enough to, not question
 None, not question
 alex is now never going to get the gyroscope wrong because he's got the right representation, not question
 well i don't know either that on my trees or my colors or my multiplication tables so i have to go back to this book the audubon society field guide to north american trees and how to solve the problem, not question
 that's powerful poison, not question
 pm into a box the test them and then the other side comes mostly failures, not question
 procedures over my call and just as well methods whenever you like these are the stuff of what artificial intelligence about methods algorithms representations like the one more example, not question
 and if this were a philosophy class that stuff right there and just say, not question
 is that will put their hand and arthritic posture color right can screw rule aptly named because people who use a ten to get the right answer about fifty percent of the time, not question
 None, not question
 initial situation now course there are other situations like this one for example, not question
 that's exceeds and places us, not question
 None, not question
 so very position the farmer can be each of the other things can be on either side of the river, not question
 reception and action, not question
 actually figure out how many customers you get for the number of advertisements replacing the newspaper, not question
 should be the same solution twice, not question
 explain the past predict the future understand the subject and control the world, not question
 None, not question
 they should be informal, not question
 not a representation for let's say that artificial intelligence is about representation, not question
 None, not question
 you better believe generator with for certain properties that make generators good for compilation not be redundant, not question
 it's the graph of situations, not question
 with the models using probabilities will models using physical and computational simulations, not question
 what's the right representation for this problem, question
 what i'm going to do is tell you about artificial intelligence today and with the subject is about, not question
 at what time it is about that with the sun's about to will and now our model for models of thinking, not question
 it's gonna go off now right next piece is going off that way to, not question
 that's something we call artificial intelligence generated test, not question
 because after all in the, not question
 thinking perception and action and they should not be strange to, not question
 please, not question
 with me like all for, not question
 others are, not question
 enable, not question
 fucks produce, not question
 there's been about a ten percent turnover in the in the in the roster in the last twenty four hours i spent another ten percent turnover, not question
 the tree leaf i picked off a tree, not question
 i guarantee that what they will do, not question
 symbolic labels gives power over concepts what are you i should also say this is a very simple idea generate, not question
 to be two for a few says aggressively and without hesitation asked for sixteen possibility so we can actually draw out the entire graphic small enough, not question
 None, not question
 so what you have a neighbor something and start talking about it and the vocabulary gives you power so they call us the rumpelstiltskin principle, not question
 we might grab picture looks like this, not question
 advil programs so it's about it's about algorithms, not question
 my constraints expose my representation that my mouth started thinking perception action so rooms of my call them just as well, not question
 we know that those are not the right representation somehow we get the sense the right representation must of all something about the location of the participants in the scenario, not question
 to add something it's a good very good so what you know the name you start to talk about it so you know the person i was pretty much like a wedding on the end of a rope, not question
 with a tiny, not question
 generate and test method consists of generating, not question
 None, not question
 goose is on that side the fox and the rain is on that side, not question
 cuz algebraic notation exposes the constraints that make it possible, not question
 so we're going to say it's not only about thinking it's also about perception, not question
 i have never, not question
 hi welcome to six three four, not question
 there's another position over here with a farmer fox news and drain the fact is the only one, not question
 and my beer pong about the situation pepsi high can, not question
 and that's why we build representation that's why do algebra in high school, not question
 i'm thinking perception and actually now my city well what's a representation a good can i do so like to take a brief moment to tell you about gyroscope now many of you have friends in chemical engineering what are the best ways to embarrass them is to say here's a bicycle will and if i spent an and blow hard on right here on the edge of the wheel is about turnover this way or this way, not question
 some olives targeted thinking perception and action may no that's not quite enough because or have model, question
 in the subject we're going to talk about problems involving thinking, not question
 so when i do that usually very intuitive very natural sunny do all the time or any of the name we're gonna call generate and test, not question
 and we know that the farmer and execute the movement from one situation to another, not question
 None, not question
 so now we're getting somewhere with the problem it's them it approach the former fox news and gray problem i'll stop you in your little kid, not question
 all because the other how many i got for ten, not question
 them it approaches to make models, not question
 because we are electrical engineers not mechanical engineers we know about representation we're gonna do is we're think about a little bit when using duck tape to help us think about just one piece of the wheel sandwiches think about that piece the wheel, not question
 so when i go into those places so having got the representation write something magical has happened we get our constraints exposed, not question
 they're targeting that, not question
 i'm going to start by talking about what artificial intelligence is and why we do it, not question
 yes i do believe and i have a name for much have a name for something, not question
 is it, not question
 looks like there's, not question
 this not of lost the glasses of course six classes in engineering school class of them it plus so many more than that and therefore we're going to talk about models, not question
 so i might say well if we take this class will i get smarter than the answer is yes you will get smarter because my better model of your own thinking not just the subject matter of the subject the better models of your own thinking, not question
 seven is full of powerful ideas me some every class, not question
 whatever we do with the models in humanities class, not question
 good thing she's chattering like mad at something we'll talk about later to motor stuff and how it helps thing, not question
 with, not question
 i should be able to absorb information such as this is a deciduous tree don't bother looking at the conference, not question
 and the joy out the entire graph, not question
 None, not question
 we are young eng of both genders and we have a duncan was done can, not question
 i know many of your sight years wanting money know if this is something you want to do so i'm going to tell you about what we're going to do this semester and what you'll know when you get out of here, not question
 well it must have something to do with thinking so let's start up here a definition of artificial intelligence by saying that its about thinking whatever that is my definition artificial intelligence has to be rather broad, not question
 the farmer, not question
 hello walk you through this at one, not question
 and it is full of, not question
 None, not question
 None, not question
 there's a river and the ear about the can i carry the farmer and one of us for possessions, not question
 it's the thing for unwinding now have a place to hang that knowledge, not question
 because model making is whatever it is about, not question
 if not support, not question
 but every once in a while we get something, not question
 i will still can't principle says that what you can name something you get power over you know if the whole thing is on the end of your shoe lace, not question
 so artificial intelligence about constraint expose my ribs and patient support model stargazing well actually there's one more thing to not quite done, not question
 i don't know if i can do this microphone to will see what happens to be a good year we got, not question
 so what is it, question
 and that's about action, not question
 right knee jerk reaction to say we are how to build models as over doing it with bill model d differential equations, not question
 stop by eighty two and he was offices and a c and i will be less often on campus but will be here quite often and definitely love to be more, not question
 i should that products would generic that equity products, not question
 or even sure there, not question
 and it's always my story possession my personal story and, not question
 this story is actually, not question
 i open the tree trunk, not question
 oh actually, not question
 lot of these terms will newly introduced, not question
 changes from private to public, not question
 have, not question
 and quite a few of them, not question
 what's up how's the final mathematics but, question
 recently doubled up the main instructors is we have newly added back lectures mostly focusing onionn, not question
 okay yeah that's about right twenty percent and how many students are you in finance and business major, question
 to prepare you some basic background knowledge about the financial markets, not question
 oh, not question
 and products will be listed as securities on the suggestions, not question
 the point i'm trying to tell you is before you dive into any details of mathematics, not question
 None, not question
 is it, not question
 experiencing this change, not question
 practitioners from the industry trouble with family talking about examples how, not question
 are you still answering my question he handed over the training manual for annual employees and you analysts, not question
 and are members of the public happen, not question
 the first day i set down, not question
 is it okay yeah and so we got some good response last year so with the support of the math department we decide to expand, not question
 so what has changed over the last twenty or thirty years, question
 hi training mathematics and computer science, not question
 and that's with different, not question
 after the primary market, not question
 that's the question you need to ask those people to know the specifics, question
 today's lecture was a story, not question
 any, not question
 this is the field event in the last, not question
 you're the one hundred to vega of zap unworkable kind of a, not question
 and you know i certainly didn't expect i will be doing this when i was at my key but i did that in the last, not question
 that's, not question
 and to now of days if you walk on the trading floor in the country part of the traitors most of them have advanced degrees, not question
 what are the forms, question
 with that i will give you some background of all the financial markets, not question
 most of the hurricane how many of you are engineering majors, not question
 and the new this ways really just sent us emails and that which you'll find from the class website, not question
 it from the outside probability the statistics and the sum so has the calculus to give you the foundation to understand the mass, not question
 is the right or wrong you mathematics is it right or wrong you fix, not question
 think about what is really the for what is really finances law is really about, not question
 to calm the police agree to do a trade, not question
 no re the sound of your quest just ask some question to raise your hand and give us a, not question
 with the rest of the story off of a delta gamma say that which you one from, not question
 again what's in common, question
 the story actually was in the mid nineties, not question
 to join options trading desk, not question
 this is the second time we have in this class we had last year in small evolution, not question
 and i'm obviously not gonna tell you the story of pilot life of pie it's not the financial story, not question
 twenty years so, not question
 visit me to open course ware not w that m it dot edu, not question
 i myself personally, not question
 loans, not question
 to go to morgan stanley in new york, not question
 it was probably one of the data point, not question
 primary listing, not question
 i will just left salomon brothers that was my first financial industry job, not question
 local, not question
 but hows concept established or, question
 some of them typically join the firm's in the mail room, not question
 bombs and the occurrences for the already given the forms so, not question
 your future career you factor last year, not question
 obviously we have offices here you can use it, not question
 you know this is suppose we options trading the s so he look in the kennel puzzle, not question
 weekly ad that's right okay so i turn around asking my desk phone as it was available, not question
 participants products matos methodology everything are changing very rack, not question
 and everybody was stock is one form of treating people one for my financial products, not question
 so what we witnessed in the last thirty years was really transformation, not question
 no one has money to lend out someone these borrow money, not question
 kappa is actually a greek letter, not question
 and, not question
 it, not question
 None, not question
 just one, not question
 new filter, not question
 this industry, not question
 that's why i to work right now and but my i forgot to mention that even that but i'm affiliated with suppose that nasty pond and the some school yet so so anyway thanks for that will be doing been more polling along the way may need to get the back of how you feel about us, not question
 mostly thirty years, not question
 start it and that's really the history part of this, not question
 very quickly as i can found sum of others and i caught cap the last seventeen years, not question
 None, not question
 and so i turned around i ask my desk light, not question
 on, not question
 okay and how many of you a mass message, question
 and a quiz in, not question
 and became traitor late on that's typical career path, not question
 it's not like, not question
 new content and the we put the pretty reckless about the mass for that they have, not question
 i won't tell your wife the truth story related, not question
 when accompanied, not question
 actually found a mans so actually and was stanley is not called vega is caught cap, not question
 why did i tell you the story what points i try to make, question
 of the tree of the treating profession coming from, not question
 heater and to go in the bus is passes so i'm compatible to vegas to buy two of the photos so it what's unique about of a on this list, not question
 okay, not question
 very, not question
 yeah and, not question
 when you start it, not question
 result really subject to exchange rules or the underlying treating agreement, not question
 the further i look at on the same page that was actually a footnote which i copied them so the footnote about why is called a kappa at the, question
 and once the stock is listed on the exchange, not question
 will we talk about trading stocks of those of people trade baskets of socks the groups of socks and that's stock index or indices, not question
 None, not question
 and the different regions have different changes and markets as well and they typically specialize in local products local company stocks, not question
 the security highest product or standardized whole you know what awaits you define that, not question
 and what you really need to ask questions is, question
 there's a changes right they become centralize the stock exchanges futures exchanges all over the world, not question
 so that's the story so, not question
 finance was a quantitative profession that's always, not question
 and educated traders, not question
 that's, not question
 None, not question
 None, not question
 it's not really, not question
 None, not question
 for the people who haven't heard about before it's a measurement about a book of portfolio or position sensitivity quality so what is volatility, question
 play was introduced, not question
 in modern finance and help you decide if this is a few that you would be an, not question
 how many of you actually know what vega, question
 right so, not question
 damn it open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 i'm always family, not question
 where is that make a report a case i can show you, question
 and that the pricing model of options as you know, not question
 so anyway today yes yeah i will we will have a mighty you know switch on listed on the website, not question
 okay great cuz last year we had quite a few so i want to specifically tell you that you're very welcome to attend because he is so is open door and last month but we have a couple of students from harvard, not question
 goes to this i appeal process, not question
 when we finish the class we had a few students coming to work in the industry so what campbell is seventy so work else were, not question
 it's very mind, not question
 which again you the more you know rigorous terms, not question
 oh captain, not question
 does not have to be, not question
 mute off it is really a measurement or indication of hall bottle power what's the standard deviation of a price can change over time okay just so even though right now i'm not gonna ask questions later so my that's a hot look in the set, not question
 that's my first day and was stanley but, not question
 eighty percent of case that is that's a how many credits since i get this over from, question
 so anyway i was taught, not question
 we just, not question
 further solidify you math knowledge learned on, not question
 last year of the policies gel and i i'm by the way i'm jake shaw and that's out of a city and we were the main instructors last year now we've doubled up to full pay instructors that's about peter cancel and that up the tube on the, not question
 so, not question
 i really just one form of treating and when you think of me the many other ways of treating aside from exchanges, not question
 anyways so that was my first day side jobs and learn how to, not question
 so that's that's really the goal and at the same time obviously you will, not question
 okay i feel how many of you actually from other universes the, not question
 that's one way of treating which is centralized, not question
 i would say, not question
 no financial products is, not question
 okay we know so anyway i'm not gonna it just, not question
 so we talk about markets we know the thirty days right people need to exchange goods you have something i don't have something you don't have so, not question
 kappa is also called the big up by some uneducated traders salomon brothers wedding fried to join they have mistaken vega as a greek letter after gambling in vegas so, not question
 and it becomes traded in the market with cut secondary trading, not question
 mathematical will quantitative finance is that by the, not question
 and mostly, not question
 discuss to the total units of credit and how twice a week so we have every tuesday and thursday afternoon from two thirty to four as you know in this classroom, not question
 home so that it is applied, not question
 yes, not question
 and, not question
 so that the different types of hard to start give listed on the stock exchange goes to ipo initial public offering process, not question
 currency issued by different countries, not question
 any concept in finance in this class, not question
 the website is www dot dot, not question
 mostly, not question
 i found something was missing, not question
 is over the counter meeting, not question
 the primary market, not question
 so i will use today's for such as time to give you introduction really, not question
 or the mascot is going to smoke with finance part is been confusing, not question
 define verify because this is a feel the transformation about, not question
 obviously the last ten fifteen years now we have the cs you actually electronic platforms trait over you know you enlarge a volume of those traits, not question
 the black shows in the seventies some of the run what made gumbo earlier but, not question
 to make a donation or view additional materials from hundred of them it courses, not question
 and curses money itself was he traded, not question
 will be used in those examples in the lecture hall by the practitioners from the industry and its purpose of this course is ready to give us amply manual to see, not question
 okay if you had your that and so hopefully this will give you enough information to decide this is a few of you like the sue, not question
 some terminology is will be use which you may not have heard before, not question
 glasses here for the seventy on cam doesn't mean i'm gonna be the instructor on mondays at the advisor and this is worth three three cartons, not question
 so this is actually on hopefully get you use to playing against other people who are playing correctly which is not something you can calmly learn just from, not question
 i think the way that we can tackle this thing it is kind of a way i recommend that you learn anything complicated so, not question
 very similar to each other but then the tournament that really matter will be completely different at least relatively different so that's under that that's they'll make you get a feel for what these guys have to go through um so let's talk about her rose, not question
 let's go into the game plastic more so posers crib that's probably frost which is really cool so poker stars is is generally considered like the most reputable on line poker site that's why we use them so they have two different types of games of everyone employment games now will, not question
 definitely not okay for real money how ever their play money seen is is pretty resilient and that's or taking advantage of your the process play money scene is broken down to two different things they have like public intrigued just go and play for like play chips in against anyone in the world which is cool and you can do that when i recommend you give it a shot just to get used to the software i'm in addition you can do home searches what were generally gonna be doing that so they call the like private leaves, not question
 None, not question
 None, not question
 from like playing around with your friends on in addition, not question
 alright everyone so welcome to fifty dot es fifty people there and analytics services gonna be monday wednesday friday from three thirty to five i just got a room for review session on tuesday thursday for anyone who needs to catch up a little bit, not question
 visit mi to open course ware at os ew dot am it dot edu, not question
 and then for their second tournament there giving us all of those things plus an ipad air and an i pad mini but we're not done yet because this class is focused on playing live we're going to end the class with alive tournament sponsored by october on the thirty first which is the day after the last day of the class so after leagues over after you guys are good at poker but you'll have an opportunity to play each other in alive tournament, not question
 listen i pad plastic end of us to go pro i want this to reflect, not question
 we were gonna break this down to three different sections like fundamental concepts, not question
 which is good means given by that poker chip for the pain, not question
 None, not question
 if you're in the us you can do real money like it used to be some was very gray area, not question
 practice which are actually implementing those concepts when like when you have ten seconds to make a decision and then more advance stuff okay so where it was going to concepts i'm gonna call this of the basic framework for decision making it's like being on explorer we like you wanna get to level when you sit down at a table every pro in the room doesn't turn ago i wanna set back as table you wanna be slightly winning player way before you want to become like a huge wedding player in order to let you know the type of thing that we're learning i'm gonna label the sides with this indicate that this is like a basic concept learn this thing before you move are the advance stuff is once you once you learned how to do things which is like how to do things is pretty is pretty broad we're gonna learn like minor adjustments that we can do to get on quite a bit of extra money but how to grind out that i need that additional like half big blind in our out of out of our opponents, question
 and this pros we'll just grind those out though get use to the structure and that's real world, not question
 it became and then there was one progress eight which turned out to be like legitimately like a ponzi scheme and as a result now procure in in the us is it much more black and white, not question
 i know it so let's, not question
 no like no live pro to get as many hands are analyzer play in the way that you can do online dishes it's not a comparative so this is giving even if your of your whole intention is to only play on live the entire reciever life doing this type of analytics would give you a chance to learn at a much faster rate and learn things that you and never see live so every week we're going to have a major tournament which is basically gonna be the same structure maybe a lol bit slower than the ones we do delhi except they're gonna have real prizes so of tuna is giving us for their first tournament, not question
 it open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 and then a lot of discussing the focus on practice which is how to actually implement late how to implement these concepts on a on a daily basis and are actually playing so especially live like we are not gonna have all the information we're not gonna have a calculators and we're not gonna have that much time to make a decision so how does like applied israel time making rules of thumb figure out what you can't just ignore and what you have to definitely do and then some the psychology stuff for later actually performing live is gonna be one contract is, question
 None, not question
 there are gonna be doing proof of announces we're gonna be doing a lot of this because this is really like is this is where the value at is gonna be is getting this right, not question
 like an on-line multi table tournament firewood how it normally works is during the week and basically every single day there's a uniform out of tournament so just run every single day like at the top of the hour, not question
 okay so let's say about the lead and honestly i think they this league is going to be really cool usually the the the evolution of a player is like they're terrible at poker and then they start becoming good at playing against bad people and then when they actually start playing for real they got crushed again because there used to play against other bad people, not question
 what the what the type of things, question
 so any any real deviations from warren armando normally do in addition to medicare and medicaid was always fine like anything not related to the hand to hand decision-making process like table selection or like bankroll management or but deciding whether or not to play it that suffers really fondness can be indicated by this ac okay so i will label the side for anything that's considered advanced and stuff fish only really do when you get the concepts down, not question
 okay so that's in with pricey so the schedule is we're gonna go through what what i'm calling basic strategy which are like the the basic axioms that were gonna be using to in order to analyze the decision making process in poker, not question
 the game play aspect so this is why did i think this is i think this is really cool so producers gave us our own private lead for only and ninety people in this course and my goal here it is two separate people who are like fairly new for people who are very competitive because i don't want i don't want someone not to pass of course because they happen to be not a great poker check train this thing called beginner's the and these are gonna be daily turbo churros means like there fast if tournament is and to get the game play credit you can cash you can make money and one of them or you can play in ten of them so those who are struggling can get this game play credit by playing ten torrance which is about like a ten hour commitment, not question
 so the private in the private leagues in like a home game to have the showcase and you might notice as soon as you log in that the mi to the park at their analytics rd at the top that's such as for us that's for everyone anyone in the world who logs into poker stars a look at home games has it and my tv at the top which i think is really cool so access says i'll send a more specific instructions later i give you guys the just like the passcode what you need but actually get there will you need to do is you gonna poker stars you go to like this button which is a little house there are taxes home games and then you wanna join a game and what you do is you put the club it which is five hundred seventy three two you put the invitation code which are all gonna having stellar and then you put your real name preferably the one that is in the course because i cash after prove everyone that joins of the and i can't do justice on someone screaming and i guess after agree to some sort times and conditions, not question
 like the this is why the twenty but the live tournament scene is dominated by on-line pros it's because, not question
 None, not question
 it's headphones and apple tv, not question
 where the kind of like grinder to and then on the weekends that's when you get a lot of like a lot of the square money a lot of the like the newer guys who only play poker on the weekend and those are more gimmicky like idiosyncratic tournament but also the highest value so that's why i'm producing the the tournament structure like this for the book of your tournament will be, not question
 let's talk about what we're number to table here so i set discourses primarily gonna be from my perspective and that the decisions about what time, not question
 to make a donation or to view additional materials from hundreds of em it courses, not question
 you can there playing these on line the eggs you can collect stats that you can never get from playing live and i think this is, not question
 oh speakers and a lot of gift cards, not question
 turn those let you focus on prefect decisions which on are the area where i think there's a most to learn among people who are new at poker, not question 
glasses here for the seventy on cam doesn't mean i'm gonna be the instructor on mondays at the advisor and this is worth three three cartons, not question

 so the private in the private leagues in like a home game to have the showcase and you might notice as soon as you log in that the mi to the park at their analytics rd at the top that's such as for us that's for everyone anyone in the world who logs into poker stars a look at home games has it and my tv at the top which i think is really cool so access says i'll send a more specific instructions later i give you guys the just like the passcode what you need but actually get there will you need to do is you gonna poker stars you go to like this button which is a little house there are taxes home games and then you wanna join a game and what you do is you put the club it which is five hundred seventy three two you put the invitation code which are all gonna having stellar and then you put your real name preferably the one that is in the course because i cash after prove everyone that joins of the and i can't do justice on someone screaming and i guess after agree to some sort times and conditions, not question

 you can there playing these on line the eggs you can collect stats that you can never get from playing live and i think this is, not question
 oh speakers and a lot of gift cards, not question
 turn those let you focus on prefect decisions which on are the area where i think there's a most to learn among people who are new at poker, not question
 is there offerings and statistics on campus so i wanna make sure that you've chosen the right now so and i also understand that for some of you it's a matter of scheduling, not question
 no extend to brodeur and more sophisticated methods selectors are here from eleven twelve thirty is on tuesday and thursday the german will also be and and can call victor will also be holding mandatory recitation so please doing stellar and take your recitation it's either three to four or four to five on wednesdays and it's gonna be mostly focusing problem solving their mandatory in the sense that while we we have were allowed to do this but i don't know they're not gonna cover entirely new material but they might take cover some you know techniques that might save you some time when it comes to the exam so you know you might get by so you know attendance is not gonna be taken or anything like this but i highly recommend that you go because well they're minute or so you can not really complain that something was taught only in recitation so please register on stellar for which of the two recitation you would like to be in theirs they're capped at forty so first come first serve, not question
 another question, not question
 they're not, not question
 i need to actually throw the disclaimer i am i tend to speak too fast i'm aware of that you know someone in the back just do that that when you have no idea what i'm saying hopefully will repeat myself many times so if you average over time you'll see it's that has the double tell you that you will get the right message that i was actually trying to step to send, not question
 is a drug effective that's not in mathematical terms i have to find out which measure i want to have to call effective i want to maybe it's over seventy years times maybe so we're so there's a lot of things that you actually need and i'm not really gonna tell you how to go from the application to the point you need to be but it will certainly describe to you what point at which point you need to be at of you want to start applying to sicko methodology then once you understand what kind of question you want to answer the owner yes no answer to a one a number two on their bars tho no make prediction five years in the future who have site information and why not have site information all this things based on that hopefully you will have a catalog of the typical methods that you're gonna be able to use, not question
 None, not question
 so homework will be do weekly there's a total of eleven problems at several like this is a lot hopefully we'll to damn light, not question
 okay so the course are currently sitting in as eighteen six fifty and its cool fundamentals of statistics and tell last bring it was so cold statistics for applications and it turned out that really based on the content from the mental statistics was a more appropriate title so i'll tell you a little bit about what we're gonna cover in class with this class is about what it's not about there's several light i really there's, not question
 visit mi to open course ware at c w dot am it dot edu, not question
 this will be close books and clothes notes so the purpose is for you to get, not question
 two, not question
 okay so the pricks here and who has looked at the first problems that already, question
 if you're in the news and will see a lot of the things i mentioned machine learning it's built a lot of statistics statistics is now, not question
 it's not that, not question
 None, not question
 okay so those hands that are rate realize that there is a trooper record that the probability for this past, not question
 oh that, not question
 i want to say, not question
 None, not question
 so i've had over the years can it might be missing it but i've had students who actually write a doc file and think that converting it to pdf consistent racing the extension to see and replacing it by pdf this is not how it works and it's so i'm sure you will figure it out so please try to keep them letter size this is not a strict requirements but i don't want to see them now the there you are allowed to have to leave home works and by leaving in twenty four hours later, not question
 your support will help mi to open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 alright so why should you study statistics well, question
 None, not question
 the slides are so that we can discuss the the one that from the solas is the one that counts and i think they are also posted on the calendar on stellar as well, not question
 so the best of the two will be kept us, not question
 lightest many of you actually immediate their attention in class the goal here will be to take you so statistics somewhat evolved into machine learning in recent years and my goal is to teach you there some machine learning has a strong are rhythmic components on the sum of gifted in machine learning class that displays mostly the algorithmic component there's also statistical component right machine learns from data and hopefully so this to the civil track and there some statistical learning which arm statistical machine learning class is that you can take your so they're offered at the crack their level i believe but once you take those glasses i wanted to be ready to be able to take this class is having this to physical fundamentals to understand what you're doing and then you're gonna be able to, not question
 None, not question
 you can also plate that speed point seven five in case and of speaking too fast but i think of management alright so just last morning, not question
 yeah i'm saying that's figure that out the syllabus is the three one, not question
 i'm, not question
 and and and and you know apply in the wall and also you know, not question
 well you're always welcome to tighten them and practice yearly tax or were typing i also understand this can be a bit of a strain so just you know write them down on a piece of paper use your iphone and take a picture of it dropbox and nice new so try to find something that puts a lot of contrast of you especially if you use pencil because there and check if the rebel it readable and this is your responsibility to have a readable file in particular, not question
 not no statistical methods perfect some of people have agreed upon over the years and people understand that this is the standard but you i want you to be able to understand what the mutations are when you make conclusions based on the data that those conclusions might be erroneous for example alright more practically michael here is to have you ready to quit thinking for example machine learning class here, not question
 okay look questions asked to submit them this will be counted you have to send an email warrants or anything like this, not question
 the best of the two not the best to we will add them multiply the number by nine and it will be your now so i'm trying to be nice this is the limit switch for i can do all right so this will be the goal is for you to learn things into the familiar with them in the in the final you will be allowed to have your notes with you but i want you to midterms also we for you to develop some mechanism so that you don't actually weighs to much time on things that you should be able to do it without thinking too much you will be allowed to cheat sheets because you know you can always forget something and you will there will be to say the letter shit and you can mix you can practice yourself is writing a small as you want and you can put whatever you want on this huge fight the final will be decided by the register is gonna be three hours is gonna count forty percent you can bring books but you can bring your nose is, not question
 to make a donation or to view additional materials from hundreds of mi to courses, not question
 i just want you to you know not rest to much heat the ten best will be kept in this will comfortable of thirty percent of the final grade there do monday's at eight pm on stellar and so this is a new thing i'm not we're not gonna use the boxes outside of the math department were gonna use on the pdf file so, not question
 young that it's gonna be given that your have once like for one zero grade in stock for too late homeworks you're gonna have to come up with a very good explanation why you need actually more extensions than that if you ever do in particular have to keep track about why you've use your three options for the two midterms one is the toolbar third and one is november seven their both gonna be in class for duration of the lecture when i see the last for an hour and twenty minutes it does not mean that if you arrive ten minutes before the end of lecture you still get an hour and twenty minutes it will and at the lecture at the end of like two times for this is well no pressure only the best of the two will be cats and this will the screen will come for thirty percent of the great, not question
 yeah there's a one that's missing on both of them is in there, not question
 one mechanics, not question
 you know person sitting next you whatever things happen so we will drop their lowest problems at school or without any questions right with the into this mess will just drop your lowest score and if you turn them all in great whatever look for was fine if you miss one then gone on the other hand if you know like next week i will be attacked by rabid squirrel it's gonna be horrible i don't have to worry about my problems that, not question
 and other questions, not question
 one which stands out like a electrons and one which ends at white light comes, not question
 others, not question
 which again has three actors and import and, not question
 with color box and discover that comes out that say the white aperture, not question
 so in diagrams if i send in some random electron, not question
 involve electrons, not question
 eighteen, not question
 so i'm in this is mostly a standard lecture course there will be clusters used so by next week i need you all have flickers annual to register them on the t est website, not question
 None, not question
 it, not question
 the first lecture the content of the physics of the first lecture is relevant relatively stand alone it's going to be an introduction to basic idea that is going to haunt playing and charm us for the rest of the semester, not question
 one can't x is my old friend, not question
 true, not question
 from the uk and these are the technical names will learn the technical name for the properties later in the semester but to avoid distracting you by preconceived notions of what these things mean on the news and they use labels color harness and the empirical fact, not question
 cool, not question
 None, not question
 then with one hundred percent confidence one hundred percent of the time the electron coming to white port incident article about will come out, not question
 okay, not question
 which measures the color in the harness in particular it is possible to build a box, not question
 know what i mean by this is that it is possible to build a device, not question
 None, not question
 you've got all the books covered between you this will give you as much access to the taxes possible without forty two by four books which i would discourage you from going, not question
 are there any other track to what tions, not question
 solid six, not question
 okay so now you'll you'll you'll kill bill watson later on the a c fuse, not question
 but it's okay to be sure straight up physics, not question
 assuming all check, not question
 and they're posted on still website and link from the problems, not question
 hi everyone welcome nato for the spring twenty thirteen this is the fourth and presumably final time there will be teaching this class and pretty excited about it um so my name is alan adams all be lecturing the course i'm an assistant presser in court eight i study string theory and its applications to gravity quantum gravity and condensed matter physics, not question
 very lovely i'm, not question
 visit mi to open course ware at c w dot am it dot edu, not question
 and for two, not question
 yes please on the problem set every week will be listed when there are be equipment reading from every textbook and if there's something missing with no to cover something opposed to separating everyone tall posted jewelry readings and i'll be available on the style of website so for example in your problems that which is first one was posted will be available immediately after electrons teller website there are three papers that refers to, not question
 are these harness boxes, not question
 it does require concerted effort it's not a trivial top okay and, not question
 given that every once while you know you're the walking to school and your leg is gonna fall off for dogs going to jump out your, not question
 the result is i was driving, not question
 love so, not question
 None, not question
 is that every electron, not question
 so your job is to devote yourself to the problems that my job is to convince you at the end of every lecture but the most interesting thing you could possibly do when you leave is the problem set so you decide who are the harder job so the work load is not so bad so we have problem says do they're doing the fix box in the usual places by lecture by eleven am sharp on tuesdays okay every week we work, not question
 you're free to imagine that these boxes are built by putting you know, not question
 i'm so there are and i haven't chosen a specific text book in the discussed on the seller weight page their set of textbooks for textbooks any strongly recommend and a set of others that are nice references the reason for this is is two-fold first off there come to languages there cannot be used for quantum mechanics one is called we've mechanics and it the language mathematical languages partial differential equations the other is matrix mechanics they have big names and if the language there is linear algebra and different books emphasize different aspects and use different languages and the also tried payment different problems some butcher in towards people were to materials science some books are in poor people action floss of each and depending on what you want get the book that soon to okay and and every week i'll be providing with your problems at readings from each of those with the recommended taxed, not question
 similarly we can build harness box, not question
 just let me say is if this stuff works pulley trivial you would need to be here so ask questions if you're confused about something, not question
 okay, not question
 conceptual understanding material, not question
 None, not question
 i met quantum mechanics twenty years ago i just really zealous i was kinda depressing so old friend, not question
 so what i really encourage you to its final group of people to work with every week and make sure that, not question
 yeah use i don't know i don't think so um i think it's going to happen at the end of the semester, not question
 None, not question
 None, not question
 right after prom see yourself, not question
 oh that's an interesting question um i don't of the top of my head refuse me an email and all projects i do know several other lecture series that i like very much but i don't know if there build on you tube or publicly, not question
 i will call them color and harness but the, not question
 color and the way it works is this it has three aperture is an import and two out ports, not question
 does not matter what inside but if you want a little idea i can imagine putting a monkey inside the hyper intelligent monkey, not question
 okay, not question
 it's also my most powerful tool, not question
 and so here's a thought and i think i want to come on the white after seven into a color box again, not question
 there is so the deal is, not question
 every looking that's ever been observed is either black or white, not question
 if that logic of this lectures based on a very beautiful discussion in the first two chapters of a book by david albert called quantum mechanics and experience it's a book for philosophers but the first few chapters really lovely introduction at a non technical level in anchorage to take a look at them, not question
 okay, not question
 so cheap property, not question
 i'm, not question
 i need to focus on two properties electrons, not question
 lots of other people castles in be confused if i'm not answering a question with out you asking the no one's getting the point right so ask questions don't hesitate in rob just read your hand i'll do my best calling you on and this is true both a lecture also got office hours and recitation ask questions i promise there's no such thing as a terrible question someone else will also be confused, not question
 these are the most unsettling experiments ever done, not question
 now if you want, not question
 what's the best interests questioning soon so to practical things to know the first thing is everything that we put out will be on the still a website lecture notes homeworks exams everything is going to be done through stellar include your grades the second thing is that as you may notice there are other more likes than usual and where in the mike and or the finds out we're gonna be video taping the score for the lectures for c w and if you don't want to you know if your happy that cool if not to sit on the side and you won't appear anywhere in video, not question
 today i want to describe to you, not question
 it open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 and no other color will never seen a electron there are no green electrons known as are found florescent will there either black or they are white is a binary property, not question
 okay, not question
 hard electrons come out this port and soft electrons commit this port, not question
 yeah i lose policy newly workers attempted what so ever, not question
 so finally, not question
 in order to really develop intuition essential things to solve problems so it the way you develop a new intuition in my solving problems and bike dealing with new situations new contact me regimes which is what we're gonna do email for it essential the work on the problem sets, not question
 where are the harder the air soft binary properties, not question
 they have been performed, not question
 they'll call the color box that measures, not question
 okay what actually makes you learn better and clicker's are an excellent example that, question
 could we work this out of you know ahead of time come to us we need you that well ahead of time then it for him, not question
 okay, not question
 however, not question
 oh awesome honey on our new, not question
 there never squishy no never from when the dribbles, not question
 now not so much but we will drop one problem set to make up for an unanticipated events will return the grated punch a two week later recitation should be easy i strongly strongly encourage you to collaborate with other students on your problems you'll learn more they will learn more it will be more efficient work together, not question
 am, not question
 okay this is been enormously valuable and it's something i wanna say just write off is that the way of organize this class is not so much based on how of the classes i was taught its base to the greek possible on incurable lessons about what works in teaching, not question
 that's my mind, not question
 secondly there harness is either hard or soft, not question
 and the utility this box is that the color can be inferred from the position if you find the particle electron over here in the white electron if you find the light in here is a black look cool, not question
 is this of course and when can squat mechanics is my daily language, not question
 so i'm no place like about it and are rescission factors are buttons reebok and matt evans yeah that's new departments are welcome him high, not question
 don't get this is the first year we haven't any one person with the same um so, not question
 particular set of experiments, not question
 so he just started a faculty position is pretty awesome um and are the is probably also follow you here hey the cake so i'm his personal complaints to so i'm just curiosity how many or course eight, not question
 sadly i can't do have a great your welcome to if you like um but hopefully i should i should not play a meaningful role in any of the the lectures so i'm gonna i'm okay so the goal of a force for you to learn quantum mechanics and buy learn when mechanics i don't mean to learn how to do calculations although that's important and critical thing i mean learn some intuition appointed development which for quantum phenomena, not question
 turn that sounds good um so i'm gonna call yeah, not question
 okay so i'm, not question
 okay that's the best way for you to develop and test your understanding, not question
 that's very valuable to me and everyone else okay i'm so before i get going on the actual physics continent class, not question
 a monkey inside and we send in a electron and monkey you know with years looks at the electron and says you know its a hard look on so that when we're at the top look consent of the other the working since i do not matter in particular leader in this miserable described in considerable detail the workings inside this apparatus and here's something on emphasized you it can be built in principle using monkeys, not question
 to make a donation or to view additional materials from hundreds of them it courses, not question
 excellent nine, not question
 no one can does not hard it has already been a hard topic is not a super hard topic it does however require two in particular everyone in this room i'm totally positive can learn quantum mechanics, not question
 there will be two midterms dates to be announced and a one final if you could have multiple that would be a little exciting um we're gonna use clippers and clippers will be required when i can think of tenants but they will give a small contribution to your overall grade and we use the most importantly for non grated but just participation concept questions and the casual in class quiz to prove your knowledge this is mostly so that you have a real time measure of your own, not question
 None, not question
 okay so let's start with our agenda the first piece in a probabilistic model is description of the sample space of an experiment so we do an experiment, not question
 None, not question
 and by experiment we just mean that just something happens out there and that's something that happens it could be flipping a coin or it could be her rolling and it or it could be doing something in the card game, not question
 None, not question
 visit mi to open course ware not w that m it dot edu, not question
 None, not question
 no I could spend a lot of time in this lecture talking about 5 the subject is important I'll keep it short because I think it's almost over anything that happens in life is uncertain there's uncertainty and Eucharist of whatever you try to do you need to have some way of dealing or thinking about this and certainty and the way to do that in a systematic way he's by using the models that are given to us by probability Theory and you're dealing with a communication, not question
 None, not question
 i'm it open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 babe main part of today's lectures to describe those actions which are the rules of the game and consider if you really tv legs apples, not question
 it's one percent excellent the baby don't need this class okay so one person who have about one hundred people in this class so there's going to be about one unhappy person i mean any where you looking life there's or in any group you look at there's always one unhappy person right so what can we do about it, not question
 okay so now we can start with the real part of the lecture let us set goals for today, not question
 None, not question
 so probability is probability theory is the framework for dealing with uncertainty for dealing with situations in which we have some kind of randomness so what we want to do is by the end of today's lecture to give you anything that you need to know how to set up what does it take to set up a probabilistic model and what are the basic rules of the game for being with probabilistic models so by the end of this lecture you will have essentially recovered half of this semester's tuition that so we're going to talk about probabilistic models and more details of the sample space which is basically description of all the things that may happen during random experiment and the probability lol which describes our beliefs about which outcomes are more likely to occur compared to other outcomes probability laws have to be a certain properties that we call the actions of probability so, not question
 so this is another possible sample space for the experiment where i flip a coin just once, not question
 to make a donation or view additional materials from hundred of them it courses, not question
 None, not question
 None, not question
 it's been from a stable equilibrium the resultant, not question
 let's assume that that some instant of time, not question
 right now i also have to measure things from some location so i need to define what i mean by why equals zero and i will define white zero the position where if the mass is at that location, not question
 let me continue now using this information and try to reduce it to the minimum set of it cracked, not question
 so here is now my mathematical description the mass is a point and of mice and on which two forces act that is the force fs due to the spray and the force a g two to the fact that this mass is in the gravitational field and therefore there is a gravitational force on this math f g okay we call this a force diagram or sunday because of the free body diagram, not question
 it's one of them times the next full switch to force to to the spring minus the force to do the graphic to kate so, not question
 from hope so i know what will be the force f s when the situation is as shown over that alright it at time t so at this time, not question
 None, not question
 okay let me immediately start with a concrete example, not question
 in other words, not question
 this free body diagram of the situation, not question
 and by the way, not question
 understanding waves and vibrations i have very important practical applications and furthermore they the fact that they existed this phenomena exists has tremendous consequences on the world, not question
 and the boobs that this is still, not question
 how about the gravitational force well that is of course the a c minus and g to force of gravitational field on that mask and indian its mind this in the y direction here because it's, question
 so to describe that we use newtonian mechanics, not question
 None, not question
 it's, not question
 mathematics, not question
 in two, not question
 what i have here is, not question
 i know you've seen this often but i pod it's not all this what will happen to bring me pull the mass out in the mass maple just bring more down it may oscillate everything until you've, not question
 describe what you see, questions
 where these masses are these various times so i will define a coordinate system this is a one dimensional situations only need one corvette now corded wife my why will be, not question
 i'm not smart enough to do it is but because the teachers or whoever wrote the book etcetera is so familiar with them the to heal do several steps in his head to her head and you don't know about it for this first example i will try to avoid anything of that kind later on the fast and i'll do the same as everybody else but at the moment as i say i'm going in gory detail okay so, not question
 net force on the pot so why could zero is the equilibrium position and then the position of the spring when it says no mass attached is a distance y zero from that, not question
 we are dealing with forces and mass, not question
 i'm people from professor of physics of them it is joining my colleague professor waterloo in to help you understand the physics of ways and vibrations now you may well ask why i spent so much effort on waves and vibrations and the answer is very simple if you take any system disturbed from equilibrium, not question
 and by the way you may notice i'm going very slow here i'm doing that intentionally i'm going to go here in gory detail every part you know because all said i know that one one go select chair studies in the book etcetera what you look at some steps from one to another one step to another and you can't figure it out the reason for a dolphin is not that you, not question
 visit me to open course ware not w that i'm it dot edu, not question
 so we know that, not question
 None, not question
 so the, not question
 go to the spring will be in the spring constant times it's extension at that instant of time it is a factor, not question
 and i know from you telling in mechanics that, not question
 read the fine y equals zero to be the place where why double dog the second is zero, not question
 it's pouring this math stuff okay now what else do we know, question
 is, not question
 actually writing algebraic equations about the defective one notice old hahahah i've note to myself in something here this has to be a the direction of light, not question
 None, not question
 these two forces from the information i wrote of at and so that is equal one over dishes f over and, not question
 imagine that you take this is a small mouse and and you attach it to that spring at some instant of time and in the process of attaching it you may stretch the strings of the screen may not this instant not distract but let's assume while you are touching the job and stretch the spring little bit you holding it all right, not question
 was zero at t zero was station so this is the beginning of our chance of dating all the information we got that here, not question
 take, not question
 this is because of the force acting it will its motion will change and it will have an acceleration whose i call a of the, not question
 if, not question
 None, not question
 as shown on the right in order to be able to describe this i have to tell you, not question
 None, not question
 do not correspond to what one actually sees you know your theory understanding is hot, not question
 the degree of force of gravity pulling it down and the spring force putting it up cancelled so that is no, not question
 None, not question
 None, not question
 therefore i can, not question
 this is the diagram, not question
 waves and vibration two different didn't exist you wouldn't recognize on a huge difference, not question
 None, not question
 we know that, not question
 and in all this i don't have to write things over and too many things of the a in these equations i was defying the symbol why with two dots on it as the second derivative off why with respect to time one dot is the first derivative of velocity etc, not question
 unfortunately it's a single equation but i have more than one hundred because i don't know why zero and i don't know why if the clearly i won't be able to solve this equation alright but the that stage i go back to the information i told you at the beginning, not question
 it's a fact it's in the y direction, not question
 it's a lie zero is big ben numbers and why it this is a positive number therefore it's pretty distraction sprained will call the mass up so this is in the y direction this is tough, not question
 at that instant its velocity is zero stationery you let go, not question
 next we also know something about this spring i told the beginning that i could sending an ideal spring so for the purpose of this problem is she moving i have disposition fictitious thing a spring would essentially has no max last month which overpays exactly hoax lol and here i com help digress and point out to you that that's a terrible misnomer fixing that is no, not question
 i can now, not question
 the second hospital this since universe is described in terms of mathematical equations we can't solve those equations, not question
 if there are forces acting on the mass that, not question
 damn it open course ware continue to offer high quality, not question
 good good everything down very cast we know that we define white code zero to be declared a position, not question
 that of course is the second derivative of why respect to the, not question
 from this, not question
 understood what's going on you cannot predict the outcome, not question
 imagine you have an idea let's drink a spring database hooks lol heated and i'm shown to the spring constant okay then from natural length l zero and you suspended from the ceiling, not question
 two reasons one tactical to be able to predict what will happen but the other far more important, not question
 hooks law of nature it is an impractical relation which tells you the force the spring exert would you structure decide to distance it but then you a it stopped and started cleats hooks lol so cokes lol, not question
 finally i told you that the velocity of that is, not question
 this is an extension of this spring will be of course why zero minus why why t okay it's and so i get the the force, not question
 None, not question
 solve it and predict what will happen to the cold that problem self, not question
 recall that time she, not question
 from a equals as an from this i get the deck celebration, not question
 not gives the right, not question
 first look around, not question
 then why is zero we know that the second derivative of y zero not accelerate so that's a condition we must not forget and nothing we know that initiate the and other words it could zero the position of that mass is why michelle, not question
 it is the way we have the objective way we have off checking with our understanding of the universe is correct or not if the predictions, not question
 describing a situation with which we would like to on the stat, not question
 a given situation converted into mathematics, not question
 f is there is the sound of the force to do the spring and go to grab it, not question
 therefore, not question
 is the total force divided by and i can now the place, not question
 emotion is ways and vibrations so somebody common phenomenon not only is it very common, not question
 what is the role in playing in this course, question
 we find that can be use for the description of nature that is mathematics in terms of mathematical equations, not question
 nice we're having acceleration which will be equal to the net force acting on it divided by the nasty inertia of that system so that is what he will be i further told that victor that forces objectives so the net force acting on this mass is the sum of those to victoria of some of those two forces so, not question
 to answer that question i have to be mind you what is the scientific method in essence the scientific method has to compile, not question
 and that means predict result of stuff situations of experiments which is needed to see before, not question
 increase right that why i position would why of t zero this is zero four zero zero to one of and in two k k one minus angie and i need you to from this get that okay while seattle is angie there, not question
 now, not question
 my role is related to the second part, not question
 question is what will happen can you predict what will be the emotion that part, question
 okay this is a vector equation pop all the parts are in the same direction in the y direction therefore i can re write this just in the equation for the one component and not bother to write the wise a white hat slot so this equation i really to now just removing dui hat tight so this is how the mass will be accelerate, not question
 make a donation or view additional materials from hundred of them it courses, not question
 the one and only language that can be used, not question
 game, not question
 what i would want to help you and, question
 we will be giving out what for the come in the room will have handouts for you everyday so look for them on if you come in late will normally means on in the entrance way here i know that some of you have a long walk between glasses on so the handouts will be available so when you come rather hand out come on in to class, not question
 i was like i am i've taken chemistry am quite convinced chemistry bears is not relevant to biology and anyway i was told i was wrong i was sure i was right i took chemistry and realized that, not question
 i'm not sure when it's gonna be for all of you, not question
 because i want you to make the world a better place for my for my daughter, not question
 we'll pressing problem then what we is out there somewhere that is only we knew the molecular weight problems of the world and the salt, not question
 actually can become a super hero by worrying about those chemical principles and then we can drive you to the greater than okay as well so i want to teach you how to be a superhero i also gonna teach you about esl utility acid base and oxidation reduction reactions, not question
 but is its mit so, not question
 so so nice and i were classmates, not question
 so we could row and i were classmates, not question
 and then molecules can react, not question
 so creating docs to be used in surgery he knows the doctors got the right amount of a tumor you don't want to take more flash than you need but you don't wanna miss some of the cancer so you wanna image exactly where the cancer is chemistry is designing sensors to find explosives in war zones this is really important problem right now, not question
 so this is the summary for today so today is really more about announcements and what we're gonna cover but there some features of today's handouts that will that you can use throughout, not question
 you wouldn't be wearing the clothes are very pretty much a chemist figured out the material that you're wearing, not question
 if you wanna spell i'm it gotta learn about the ideal gas law, not question
 another thing that i didn't appreciate about chemistry was in the lab course i had we had a strong basin we gas and we were drop drop drop drop drop until i turn pink and we can calculate the molecular weight of an unknown be passing and i ask myself, not question
 that days class, not question
 some of you may not find your love for chemistry until next year or senior year and um it or evening graduate school or even when you have a job later on, not question
 i would like you to apply chemistry, not question
 i also want you to know enough chemistry so you can do your opt in chemistry lab and we'll talk more about the undergraduate research program throughout the course, not question
 i heard the correct answer out there, not question
 because i think it sends it says something very important, not question
 restart the quest, not question
 boy i'd i'm an engineer now and i have to work with him is all the time and i really wish i had paid more attention in chemistry class because we need to work together and i need to understand more what they're doing so some people do not find their love for their appreciation for chemistry till they have a career later in life so, not question
 so we need to learn about matter and we need to know how matter reacts, not question
 it's partly why think eight dollars is a good price to spend on these hands three times the great but they're all dead, not question
 so you'll be hearing and this is a series i call in their own words, not question
 so am i am happened running you're gonna be learning more about me as this morning goes on everybody should have a handout if you do not have handout erin will come around and give you one if you just raise your hands on those of you in the back just came in, not question
 so what chemical principles are you gonna be morning that will help you solve these real world problems, question
 visit mi to open course ware at c w dot am it dot edu, not question
 so i'm not showing you some different pictures in this class i'm gonna be showing you these pictures so no pictures will be there to but every time i saw you again like i want to show you someone's alive so the living tennis people were using chemistry every day of their lives and i'm not showing short videos of these people tell you how they're using chemistry and what chemistry is being used for today, not question
 not really a message that chemistry is not living disciplined chemistry with something that people use to do and it was exciting time but when i got there power means they moved on to other females, not question
 so who is this, question
 and then i went to college and they said you have to take chemistry of your thinking of a bio psychology major, not question
 alright so without chemistry you wouldn't be alive your body or series of chemical reactions, not question
 so we're gonna talk about how they react and whether reactions gonna go is about thermal dynamics is it's going to be spontaneous but then we also need to know if it's faster if it's slow that's kinetic summer going to cover both of those things, not question
 when you have a paper that might be currently writing on without chemistry, not question
 None, not question
 what do you think, question
 i, not question
 starting pretty simple that's why i want, not question
 so you can look who's next to and figure out you know who in your bro is going to be that famous person that one day you can say yes i was, not question
 so what is chemistry research chemistry research is all these following things, question
 so i'm, not question
 we went to college to study, not question
 sometimes when i'm traveling around and as a professor i travel the world and get fox on chatting with some on an airplane and or on a bus or something and they say what do you do and then i say oh you know i teach chemistry and i was kind of watch the reaction to that and some of them are like oh chemistry and other people say, question
 None, not question
 but if you have not found it yet i'm hoping to find a connection york connection to chemistry what about chemistry relates to what you want to do in the future and one reason and i do not appreciate chemistry in high school if i don't really understand who penis work and i didn't really understand what chemistry what's what people use chemistry for and part of the reason i think were these pictures that are often shown in courses in intro courses for chemistry and in your intro textbooks, question
 spell and nineteen without chemistry we have the am from physics ny for math and we have the tea from chemistry, not question
 i want to appreciate how chemistry is used to solve real world problems to make informed decisions about your health about the environment and energy and science policy and i want you to be able to advance science engineering through the application of chemistry principles, not question
 in the first half of the course we're gonna start with atomic theory there is going to be a little bit of history and fault and not talking about the discovery of the nucleus on electrons protons and so were gonna have a little bit of history and some cool demos we're gonna move on to the periodic table that's the chemists toolbox those are the elements that we can combine to make things and we combine them to make things they need to bond so we're gonna talk about bonding and they're gonna for molecules and we need to think about the structures of those molecules cuz the structures dictate the properties of out of those molecules about an hour, not question
 memories lecture summaries will always have the reading for the class, not question
 i would schedule i was in chorus i would schedule everyone of my music lessons during the chemistry class i did everything to avoid having to attend chemistry in high school, not question
 so, not question
 this is my chemistry research is today this is what you're gonna be using chemical principles for, not question
 are making you pharmaceuticals we haven't really produce new antibiotics and a long time in this country and a lot of things that we thought used to be treatable conditions now are no longer sm treatable because we don't have it you antibiotics and, not question
 and or how to process it and i think really importantly, not question
 biology, not question
 i, not question
 can you tell me who these people are, not question
 chemical equilibrium interaction goes one way is going in the reverse direction at the same time, not question
 it open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 chemistry really should study chemistry because the major challenges of our time require chemistry knowledge to fix them treating human disease requires understanding of chemistry, not question
 bio fuels energy alternative energy that's for chemistry is using basic principles to figure out how to design better biofuels, not question
 i did not like chemistry in high school, not question
 what do you think lisa majored in, question
 me this is my college yearbook pictures so one day you will have one of these, not question
 if your still have chemistry, not question
 so what i'm hoping that you will to hear my coursing objectives ice on i get back to the is i want you to have a working knowledge of chemistry thing you can take advanced courses, not question
 in biology and materials everything and unit on transitional part of the periodic table re a higher and cobalt and copper and nickel and all those amazing elements that really allow you to do the most challenging chemical reactions on those are especially fond and if you wanna have the power of chemistry got no about the transition that's, not question
 principles in a lab it's not a chemistry lab in your drop, not question
 None, not question
 chemistry can be very different in different circumstances and that everybody can find their appreciation for chemistry and a different time in our lives some of you right now already like chemistry but a lot of you probably have not found your love for chemistry yeah some of you may find that love for chemistry during the semester i'm hoping it'll be a large fraction if you, not question
 and that's why i want you all to have superior knowledge because my daughter needs more than adequate knowledge is to have a better world she'd superior knowledge that's my goal for all of you to teach you these things don't have to be content is in fact it's fantastic if you take the knowledge of chemistry and bring it other disciplines because we're gonna need all the disciplines coming together without solid knowledge to be able to to make this world a better place all say that there are many on five eleven one superstars in this class and the pastor came in like sarah who hated chemistry and became can major and ended up getting a phd in chemical biology on all these folks have gone on using chemistry not always and is, not question
 None, not question
 so i'm not going to give you a sense of the material so we had this on our list of topics today general information we gone through course material overview on introductions to the teaching team, not question
 and then teach them the chemical principles they now to make the world a better place for my daughter, not question
 who is this, question
 it was in fact biology what do you think i went to college to study yeah some people watch my open course ware know these yes the inner drama by a psychology that's kind of like course nine on bathroom i was interested in, question
 None, not question
 people are inconsiderate meaningless you green lantern ring horse that wearing direction that you want if the green lantern pew's always greater than ten, not question
 solve the energy problem requires an understanding of chemistry and people will come up with alternative energy i'm just lost his condenser knocking destroying the environment while they do it so i really think we need people thinking about solving the energy problem care about the environment and can use chemistry to think about how we can protect the environment so why do i care so much about this and that's because yesterday morning i walked my daughter to her first day of first grade she six years old she starting school and i need people to know chemistry to make the world a better place for her so what i can do as a mother who's a chemist is fine the smartest people i can find which i don, question
 in biological engineering, not question
 now let me tell you a little more about these these lecture notes that you can bring a pen or pencil to class to write on, not question
 when you're going back over things and thinking about it you can always welcome what reading was associated with the class, not question
 question is, question
 and will be in equilibrium constant associated with that reaction but sometimes you really wanna go more in the forward direction to make the thing you wanna may see need to think about how the reaction quotient eq is related to the equilibrium constant head and the green lantern, not question
 awesome always have a reading for the next class you can read ahead which is good for the free lecture questions, not question
 None, not question
 turn all this is kind of a good intro not working this to every day we learned about iterations because we need to know if pk can speak chinese important but we don't have a ladder or not can be doing an experiment, not question
 friends yes, not question
 or drama it was biology what do you think i am injured and it was chemistry and of course we all know that lisa is an actress and i'm canister professor so start every class with this, question
 to make a donation or to view additional materials from hundreds of em it courses, not question
 None, not question
 we were in the same year, not question
 i'll be giving some of the lectures for today along with, not question
 None, not question
 okay hopefully even started and problems and zero so i open my eighty e and then follow the next set of instructions pictures are random number between the first and the and for sponsor okay now i'm actually use python to do this and this is also an example of power just like a really simple task in your life you can use computers or programming to do that because if it was a random number i might be biased because for example you might like the number eight so to choose a random number i'm going to go and say okay where's the list of responders it starts at fifteen actually starts the sixteenth that's me, not question
 there you go, not question
 so yeah i'm getting so that's probably the big thing right there should probably highlighted it but don't be afraid, not question
 it before his calculations and a half to store them somewhere great swordsman computer memory so computer also has to remember results and these days it's not uncommon to find computers with hundreds of gigabytes of storage and, not question
 so i have to be readable and understandable by others so to that and you need to write code that's, not question
 so what we sign up for the impact of knowledge in the previous owner example was the recipe right for how to find this for box so what were the three parts of the recipe one was a simple sequence of steps right number four step sprint, not question
 internet not so computers don't know what to do without right now don't know what to do with that statement but computers do not follow recipe, not question
 None, not question
 up we go, not question
 it's a picture and this is a really fast paced course and we ramp up really quickly so we do want to position you to sixteen and of course so as i was reading this is kind of think about when i was first starting the program know what help me get through my first very first programming course and this is really like a good list so the first thing was i just read the piece that's as new as they came out make sure that you know the terminology kinda just, not question
 how is someone gonna win it will cardboard before class ends right that's repaired of knowledge comes in some part of knowledge is the recipe and how to or the sequence of steps okay sorry that's just my funny for that so the sequence of steps is imperative is incredible knowledge so if i'm a machine, question
 calculate calculation types us a pervert can put these types together and define your own calculations, not question
 okay, not question
 so this is pretty much a road map of all of six triple one for six hundred as i just explained it so there's three main things we want you to get out of this course it okay the first thing is the knowledge of concepts which is pretty much true of any cost to take right class to teach you something three lectures example test how much you know this is a class in programming great, not question
 just going to the bottom, not question
 repeat the process over and over again and that's what the rest of their as doesn't keep doing this until you decide that you're close and, not question
 but we just got up okay, not question
 it was the number again zero seven eight five o get, not question
 ri lets begin says i mentioned before this and this and this lecture will be recorded froze ew so again in future lectures if you don't wanna have the back of your head show up just don't sit in this this front area here so first of all wow what a crowd you guys were finally in twenty six one hundred six are pulling me that bank so good afternoon and welcome to the very first class of six for bowl and and also six hundred this semester so my name is annabel for me and last name bell i'm lecture in the cs department, not question
 so if a computer follows this in this other than its gonna start with the gas g but say three eight or try to find this very of sixteen we're going to calculate g times jeans nine rate harass is fifty times use close-up tax will stop and cj is the answer i'm not really happy with nine being really close to sixteen right some this and i'm not stopping here i'm gonna keep going that so if it's not close enough then i'm gonna make a new gas but having g averaging gian x over ge so that's x energy here and that's the average of their and the new average is going to be my new gets hot and that's what it says and then the last step is using new gas repeat the process so there we go back to the beginning, not question
 visit mi to open course ware not w that and it dot edu, not question
 seventy five that great so i chose a random number and i'm gonna find the number in the responders she, not question
 None, not question
 so it's really about learning how to program, not question
 you would've entered a raffle okay sistema fact for today's lecture is someone will win a prize before class ends and the prize was a google cardboard right to state of the art virtual reality glasses of making a about delivered on my promise okay so that's a statement of fact but if you get super tan i'm a machine, not question
 None, not question
 and that's writing programs you need to programs are just near sometimes programs on browning make decisions for some control flow to programs so that's what the second one is going to be about, not question
 so the kind of populations that computers go there two pints of water calculations are built into the language so these are the very low level times types of calculations things like addition subtraction multiplication and so on, not question
 one thing i wanna stress and we're gonna come back to this in this this again during during this entire lecture actually is computers only know what you tell them and there's only do what you tell them to do their not magical, not question
 and not only that not only will your could be read by other people but next year maybe i'll take another course and you want to look back at some of the problems that you're reading this class you kinda want me to reread your code right if it's a big mess you might not be able to understand or understand what you what you were doing so writing reader prima could organize income is also big part and the last section is going to do with the first to actually part of the programming in introduction to programming and computer science and i thought the last one deals a little bit in there deals mostly with the computer science part introduction to programming and computer science and i am sure gonna talk about once you learn how to write programs in python how do you compare programs in python how do you know that one program is better than the other, not question
 that was fine but we're not we're not students right and we love numbers hear them it right so here's america example for that shows the difference between the cardigan part of knowledge so i want to find this word and so example declared knowledge is the square root of the number x is y six et why terms that is equal to its got but just a statement of fact it's true, not question
 go for some in class exercises which will be available on the sides and it's fun to do and it's also great if you could take notes, not question
 and once you have a language that has these sort of primitive, not question
 None, not question
 exile, not question
 okay so we're gonna choose a random number between sixteen and the and person to sixty six, not question
 okay so then, not question
 i am about on the code just singing just for future reference, not question
 the first type of knowledge is declared of knowledge and those are things like statements of fact and this is where my email came in to play if you read all the way to the bottom, not question
 it's a taxes originally sixteen, not question
 thanks, not question
 they don't have a license they just know how to perform calculations really really quickly but, not question
 and the last part of the recipe was a way to stop it you don't want to program that keeps going and going on for recipe you don't want to baking bread forever right you wanna stop at some point, not question
 that's really in particular road map of this course looks like, not question
 there was a flow of control, not question
 order will help them it open course ware continue to offer high quality educational resources for free, not question
 so here's the another them to find the square root of a number, not question
 and here's don't know anything marked it come to that so let's let's go into the types of knowledge, not question
 None, not question
 learn how to program is part of it is figuring out what what objects to create learn about these later honey represent knowledge with data structures outside the broad term for that, not question
 okay that's all for a bit and seven ministers part of the course so let's let's start by talking a lot at a high level what is the computer do so fundamentally does two things one performs calculations for the performance a lot of calculations are computers these days are really really fast a billion calculations per second is coming up not far, question
 i don't know anything except what you tell me what you tell me so i don't know i know that you tell me the statement like a, not question
 is a little bit more abstract and it deals with how do you write the code, not question
 worst case you just restart the computer and, not question
 the second part of the scores, not question
 can you create times types of calculations on the computer will be able to to perform those as well, not question
 how do you know that one program is more efficient than the other and you know that one algorithm is his is better than the other so that's where we're gonna talk about in the last part of the clippers, question
 that's the flow control, not question
 later on in in the term professor consent missing right and there will be giving some of the lectures as well okay so today we're going to go over some just basic chemistry but of course information, not question
 something and then during lectures no collector was talking about something that you suddenly remembered i saw that word and the piece that i didn't know it was will he now i know what it is right so just give it a read only to start it, not question
 last thing and i think this is what makes this class really great is we teach you how to solve problems and we do after the pieces, not question
 so there were parts where we made decisions and are because now there are parts where we repeated some steps should be and reset repeat steps one to three, not question
 if you knew programming i think the key word is practice so it's like math know or reading more you practice the better you get at it if you not gone absorb programming by watching me right programs desire to know how to program right you need to practice so download the code before letter follow along whatever i type you guys can type and i think also one of the big things is if your new to programming you're kind of afraid that you're gonna break your computer right and you can't really do that just by running anaconda and and typing in some commands so don't be afraid to just types in something and see what it does, not question
 an underlying all these is just practice so you have to just take from subway and code alot and, not question
 lauren zero v is there nothing so that's example of me being a machine right and also the same time using my phone and just my everyday life right just lecturing just to find a random number right so just in chinese python where you can just give you practice okay so, not question
 i'm could that's readable so when you write code you want to write it such that nearly company other people read it other people would you set, not question
 you have to tell them what what calculations to do, not question
 to make a donation or view additional materials from hundred of them it courses, not question
 the other thing we need you we want you to get out of it is programming skills, not question
 you'll succeed in this course it okay so what are the things we're gonna learn in this class feel like it but things are feeling this class can be divided into basically three different sections for the first one is related to these first june first i don't care, not question
 well organized modular easy to understand the, not question
 the last time, not question
 and so the same technique tells us how to determine the velocity from the acceleration since we saw that that was equivalent to an area under the curve problem, not question
 accosted, not question
 area of this truck has lloyd, not question
 and strips, not question
 now let's consider a more generally changing generation as a function of time so when papa's, not question
 alright as the integral, not question
 a change in velocity from time a to time b is equal to the limit, not question
 the notice that there is no arbitrary constant in the definite article in the indefinite integral we have an arbitrary constant but in the definite integral that arbitrary constant is determined by setting the integration limits so there's no arbitrary constant we just have, not question
 the exact area not deposit everybody exact area under the curve of the integral from to you face to the this limiting some, not question
 under the age of the curve, not question
 nice one i'm not going to the frog is because the idea of that these rectangles as well as i can the now or i make the rectangles the more easily i can fit them on the curb for each strip, not question
 a change in velocity delta v, not question
 turn, not question
 so for linearly changing acceleration, not question
 yes, not question
 acceleration, not question
 thank, not question
 with driven so d d, not question
 over the integral from tisa beta tisa be we can estimate this by breaking up the interval into a bunch of little rectangles supposedly disciplined and rectangles, not question
 as a token of time to change in velocity will still be, not question
 so, not question
 our acceleration, not question
 let's say from he over, not question
 over that time and travel, not question
 under a of tea over the time interval delta t, not question
 can be written as, not question
 two, not question
 and its related, not question
 the area, not question
 this is x equals a, not question
 None, not question
 and this time, not question
 times the width of the strap would you surpassed the same with will call that, not question
 None, not question
 a of the subject, not question
 consider function, not question
 a fax and suppose, not question
 the area, not question
 under the curve as a fax in the info from mexico, not question
 the fax, not question
 average, not question
 look something like that, not question
 over some time to build up the tv can this be written as a not acceleration because acceleration times, not question
 None, not question
 so just, not question
 one learns how to calculate the indefinite integral of various functions, not question
 this product is actually the, not question
 same so be, not question
 is equal to the empty derivative, not question
 you totally did it so as a retainer area involving the average acceleration but that's also equal to the area, not question
 this is again the area, not question
 will have the acceleration of the function of time and will want to find the velocity of the fucking time for the position as a function of time will use a technique called integration let's see how that works, not question
 any time will be, not question
 go back to let's assume that's a well behaved function by which i mean that it's continuous and different ball over the age of the rate of seven so consider g a fax, not question
 sometimes however want to go in the other direction, not question
 the process of integration that you've learned about a cactus which is the inverse of taking the derivative the inverse of differentiation i want to take a moment to summarize the basic principles of integration from tacos, not question
 so cockiness tells us how to solve this very problem had a computer definite general from the movie that you got from indefinite integration, not question
 acceleration function, not question
 let's begin by considering the function go fax with some derivative, not question
 to see this graphically, not question
 under the time change, not question
 integral of f a fax the axe evaluated from x equals a, not question
 now i suppose i want to convert this process, not question
 he said they, not question
 two x equals pizza this is the definite integral computed over some interval, not question
 and here's the time delta t to change in velocity a not, not question
 acceleration times, not question
 reach rectangular strap, not question
 just under the skirt, not question
 None, not question
 and this affects it was being the definite integral represents the area, not question
 the integral, not question
 first with the plot, not question
 times the width of that rectangle delta chi so that's the area, not question
 at fox being defined by the time it of all zero to delta chi and its area under the curve a not, not question
 time piece of j, not question
 six, not question
 this is a fifty, not question
 strips i want delta t to go to zero to jamaica is exactly what i would write is that, not question
 is equal to, not question
 a change in velocity, not question
 go fax plus, not question
 of a fax, not question
 all the area of each of the straps and so we want the acceleration at the i rectangles so that's, not question
 as well, not question
 just some general function on drawing like this which is our acceleration, not question
 t is some constant a not, not question
 no to we can to find an average acceleration over the interval from zero to delta t, not question
 notice from the diagram, not question
 the time it will shut it said be and this is, not question
 now this is a very important expression and we have a special way of writing it we can also write it, not question
 None, not question
 it's basically the area under the age of tea function going from zero to delta chi, not question
 between x equals a and x equals be, not question
 is equal to the average velocity, not question
 that's the area, not question
 of the function a of tea, not question
 so were just added figuring out what the area under the curve aids, question
 in that case we know that is constant federation, not question
 we wouldn't that sway on the right hand side is called the definite integral of a of the, not question
 out of ink is equal to the average, not question
 so to come back to the motion of objects we've shown that the change in velocity of an object can be written as the definite integral of the acceleration, not question
 as a function of time, not question
 how know meals traumatic functions lot with the functions etc, not question
 the strip is actually what were saying is that if we make the rectangles now enough we can treat the acceleration curve if they acceleration as roughly constant over that digital pen and we can make an is because we need to to make those rectangles very very now okay so not case we can estimate the total change in velocity from time to use of a to time and he said be by adding up the area of all of these retainer strips, not question
 if my plot, not question
 facts, not question
 write a for family, not question
 definitely to go, not question
 so, not question
 is still, not question
 concert, not question
 and, not question
 as an integral so we might as, not question
 honey, not question
 select suppose we want to go from this time he got caught t survey, not question
 panic and that can be any arbitrary constant, not question
 box one from here to here the change in velocity, not question
 equal to the same function of effects and this is because of the derivative of a constant is equal to zero, not question
 over the last time, not question
 a little bit if it will stick out, not question
 of the acceleration, not question
 None, not question
 it's in this is one two three four etc, not question
 be added to move it evaluate it acts equals me and this turns out to be, not question
 of tea of and i, not question
 okay so in that case we write that the change in velocity cells a the ssid be minus the survey of attainable also going from time a to time b, not question
 the area under the curve a of the over the time and were interested in, not question
 of the sum from j equals one to and, not question
 then the change in velocity, not question
 is, not question
 what's difference, question
 times delta t is just the area of this box, not question
 nope that if i had a constant to go fax i'll still get the same derivative, not question
 at the top, not question
 as jay goes from one to ten, not question
 cockiness also shows us how to compute the deck fitted will, not question
 None, not question
 hell to the, not question
 call this time, not question
 None, not question
 know for a fine i really should write this as approximately two because for a finite number of retainer strips this is just an approximation because i mentioned the rectangles don't exactly fit under the current they can't because the rectangle doesn't have a kirby top but the function is curved but the narrower and make the rectangles will probably larger i make an, not question
 in this way because the change in velocity from that initial velocity is given by a non hostile to the, not question
 and therefore that, not question
 this is my, not question
 the have to drive of, not question
 what's the cause and, question
 the film, not question
 so if we know the velocity at times zero and we know the center because acceleration a not we can calculate the velocity at me later talking, not question
 acceleration, not question
 left hand side of this we call an indefinite integral, not question
 six hundred h and misses tonic will zero suppose acceleration is increasing willy and all, not question
 add with of about that is g a fax, not question
 because this is curved graph i can't get the right angle to fit exactly, not question
 g of fax plus, not question
 is equal to, not question
 my function, not question
 the better the approximation will be so what what i want to do is go to the limit of an infinite number of rectangles or it will only the limit of infinitesimal in our own, not question
 suppose we have a constant acceleration, not question
 to change in velocity delta v over sometime it to full, not question
 plot acceleration vs time, not question
 after ten and with each one, not question
 the t, not question
 in the interval, not question
 under the curve, not question
 people to another function which i'll call after effects now, not question
 is my constant acceleration, not question
 d two evaluated from, not question
 suppose we have, not question
 no in calculus, not question
 and so, not question
 consider a slightly more complicated example suppose the acceleration is in constant but is changing manually, not question
 not having separation, not question
 then i can write that the empty derivative of f of x, not question
 until we see that if the derivative of g of factors of a fax plus the concert, not question
 times delta t want to evaluate that limit as bill to tv goes to zero or currently as in the number of rectangles goes to infiniti, not question
 we can use differentiation to calculate its velocity and acceleration of better times essentially by taking the derivative of the position we know everything there is to know about the motion, not question
 x equals p minus, not question
 the last time delta t o because he this graphically if i, not question
 a not that say this time zero, not question
 i can draw this graphically, not question
 you can call me what it is that i'm call you a story teller and i was like, not question
 i am in six years and i kinda got a handle on it i kinda understood this is what shame as this is how it works, not question
 they have a strong sense of love and belonging, not question
 to breeze through waiting for the doctor to call after your memory, not question
 the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that were not worthy of connection, not question
 i personally thought it was the trail, not question
 i have a vulnerability issue and you know and i know that won't abilities kind of the core, not question
 got him so i said here's the thing i'm struggling and she's with the struggle i said well, not question
 None, not question
 and i'm like it not discomfort upside the head and do that over and get always that's my thought was my mantra, not question
 None, not question
 that i won't, not question
 no so this is what i learned we now the owner dot, not question
 we struggle with that so much mi alone and struggling phone ability, not question
 what they had in common was a sense of courage and when a separate courage and bravery for you for a minute courage the original definition of courage when it first came into the english language it's from the latin word per, not question
 is i took all of the interviews where i saw where the gas russian people living that way and just look at those what do these people have in common and i have to have a flight office supply addiction but that's another talk and i had a million of them no colder and i had a sharpie and i was like what am i gonna call this research and the first words that came to my mind were whole-hearted, question
 angry and he okay he said what's going on and i said this is a therapist who sees there is, question
 and it stop controlling predicting this lead to, not question
 and it turned out to be shame, not question
 and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough he was the only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging, not question
 was that, not question
 the willingness, not question
 i found a therapist, not question
 None, not question
 he was just sweet talking me and was like, not question
 a shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness but it appears that also the birthplace of joy of creativity, not question
 my one year is turned into six years, not question
 hey, not question
 very intense data announces light went back hold these interviews pulled the stories pull the internet with the with the theme of the pattern, not question
 little break down which actually but we're like this and that led to a i call to break down my therapist called the spiritual lightning here so i can found better than break down but i assure you it was a break down and i had my data away and upon their presentation thing you know who you are when you call your friends and say i think and you see somebody who do you have any recommendations, question
 why not magic pixie i do i think about this for a second and who, question
 love it, not question
 so where i started was with connection because by the time your social worker for ten years what you realize is that connection is why we're here, not question
 i had the compassion, not question
 and i'm or the lights nessie clean it out organize it and put it into a bento box and so to think i have found my way, not question
 when were waiting for the call is twenty percent something out on twitter and on facebook that says how would you define portability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half ahead hundred fifty responses, question
 this is this is what it's all about doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection the ability to feel connected, not question
 my first meeting with our diana, not question
 was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better, not question
 and chain is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection is there something about me that other people know it or see it, not question
 as you know it's like internet well you know that so i can tell you a lot about shame but had to borrow everyone else's time but here's what i can tell you that it boils down to, not question
 yo my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with on ability, not question
 i'm really struggling with how to write about you on a little flyer with the struggle and she said, not question
 i want to understand them i want to hack into these things i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see, not question
 yes, not question
 be worthy of connection the things i can tell you that it's universal we all have at the only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and let you talk about the more you have, not question
 well what the fuck this to understand what this is saying and how this is useful, question
 there are many types contestants in this race so just algorithms with the linear runtime graphically these rough times look like a line with the slope you can imagine as a turtle the moves at a constant speed and never slows down or driving card that doesn't accelerate, not question
 it's often helpful to separate and algorithms one time be so what happens in the best case the average case and the worst case but we usually take the pessimistic view and simplify algorithms runtime two is worst case behavior, not question
 speedo covers all teleportation weather takes one second or one million years, not question
 we think the run time of algorithms as a function of the size of the input with the output is how much work is required to run the algorithm, question
 so we see that x squared and five x squared plus twelve x thirty seven orme big of each other because they're the same when we ignore the smaller terms and constance, not question
 while bigelow is important and certainly useful it isn't the end all be all big over races constant factors but sometimes those are actually important when we want to program to be performed such as a video game programmer will try to save every bit of computation even if it doesn't change the bagel run time, not question
 what may seem like the car's faster it really has the same type of speed linear which we call big of an, not question
 easy right, question
 in order to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm we generally use a technique called big ole passing talk analysis the definition of big ol is activex isn't big of go backs if and only if there is a okay and x not suffer all x greater than equal to x not at the x is less than or equal to k time she vax, not question
 the reason is that different computational models can result in different to go run times but pulley time algorithm will always be poly time regardless of the machine model, not question
 the reason we take a step forward it first for every new stat he goes back to the start repeat everything he did before and then takes the new step the time it takes it make each new step essentially doubles every time giving us a run time of big ol of tooted and, not question
 big o is also useful beyond just looking and algorithms runtime, not question
 will be go does teach us that sometimes slow and steady doesn't win the race, not question
 this is bigger of log in also known as the logarithmic function, not question
 you can think of big of she has a giant umbrella that covers all algorithms that are at least as fast as ge for example pretty much every pokemon is in big ole slow poke since they're all faster but almost no one is in big of you same bolt except for you simple to himself, not question
 we can use it as an analysis to how much space and algorithms using which is especially important if we have hardware constraints or operating on very large sets of data we can even use po isotonic analysis of problems in cells showing that it's impossible for any algorithm to solve a problem faster than a certain runtime, not question
 for example what think of a race of the could teleport, not question
 as we payed algorithms in a race against each other this will be a special kind of race with no finish line instead we prefer algorithm to have a clear lead or the other contestants have no hope of catching up because this race has no finish line we will allow the contestants to cheat and start wherever they want and even take performance enhancing drugs to multiply their speed by whatever cuts effected they want colloquial eat this means that we only focus on the largest firm in expression and ignore all constance, not question
 None, not question
 solution is the right one and how do we compare one algorithm against another, question
